Docker Hands-on Workshop
========================

Welcome to the Docker Hands-on workshop.


Our Goals
---------

1. Get [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=community&type=edition&offering=community) running on your machine in Kubernetes mode.

2. Teach you the skills to leverage Docker in your environment today.


Prerequisites
-------------

Because Docker leverages the OS's virtualization technologies, the install requirements for Docker are **very** specific.  Ensure you exactly meet these specs to get the most from our time today:

### Mac requirements:

- 2010 or newer model with Intel's MMU virtualization
- OS X El Capitan 10.11 or newer

### Windows requirements:

- 64-bit Windows
- Windows 10 **Pro**, Enterprise or Education (not Home, not Windows 7 or 8) to install Hyper-V
- Windows 10 Anniversary Update or better
- Access to your machine's BIOS to turn on virtualization
- Administrator access to run Docker Desktop and a console as Admin

### Linux requirements:

- 64-bit Linux these versions or better: Ubuntu 14.04, Debian 7.7, CentOS 7, or Fedora 24 or better
