Docker Hands-on Workshop
========================

Welcome to the Docker Hands-on workshop.


Our Goals
---------

1. Get [`docker` community edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) running on your machine.

2. Teach you the skills to leverage Docker in your environment today.


Prerequisites
-------------

Because Docker leverages the OS's virtualization technologies, the install requirements for Docker are **very** specific.  Ensure you exactly meet these specs to get the most from our time today:

Mac requirements:

- 2010 or newer model with Intel's MMU virtualization
- OS X El Capitan 10.11 or newer

Windows requirements:

- 64-bit Windows
- Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise or Education (not Home, not Windows 7 or 8) to install Hyper-V
- Windows 10 Anniversary Update or better
- Access to your machine's BIOS to turn on virtualization
